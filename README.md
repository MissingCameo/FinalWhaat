# FinalSun / FinalAlert (YR) 2 Mission Editor

This repository contains the source code for the FinalSun/FinalAlert (YR) Mission Editor.

# Building the source code
The source code consists of 2 projects:
- MissionEditor: The main mission editor application code.
- MissionEditorPackLib: Wraps XCC objects with C functions and includes some loading and packing code.

## Compilation
1)	In this example, we are going to build Final Alert 2 (for Red Alert 2). 
1)	Open MissionEditor.sln with Visual Studio 2022 and set the project configuration to "FinalAlertYRRelease". This will cause an automatic switch to FinalAlert2YR.exe.
2)	Build the project by pressing F7 (Build Solution), once completed it will produce FinalAlert2YR.exe in the "dist/FinalAlert2" subdirectory
3)	You can now run and debug the editor by pressing F5

## Updating third-party libraries
In order to update zlib, bzip, boost and lzo to newest version, start a "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022", move to the "3rdParty\xcc" folder with vcpkg and Git for Windows in PATH:
   
       git --version
       vcpkg x-update-baseline

A version of XCC is directly included in "3rdParty\xcc". It is a slightly modified and heavily stripped down version. The changes are available in `3rdParty\xcc\patch.<COMMIT_HASH>.diff`, where `COMMIT_HASH` is the commit hash of the XCC repository (at the time of this writing `3rdParty\xcc\patch.70358b46858973426c1ecf204485cb2a88716217.diff`). If you update XCC to a newer version by replacing the files, please also apply the (eventually updated) patch afterwards.

# Creating a distribution
After modifying the source code you might want to create a distribution.
Please ensure that you have taken care of everything required by the licenses (e.g. notices of source code changes and your copyright statement) and that the program itself does make clear it has been modified by you.

There is a helper script that can create the distributions in the script folder:

    cd scripts
    build_and_distribute.bat

This rebuilds everything and creates several files in the dist folder:

  - FinalSun.zip
    - Contains a FinalSun distribution
  - FinalAlert2.zip
    - Contains a FinalAlert2 distribution
  - FinalAlert2YR.zip
    - Contains a FinalAlert2 Yuri's Revenge distribution
  - MissionEditorSource.zip
    - The source code of this git repository (no uncommitted changes included)
  - MissionEditorExternalSources.zip
    - A best-effort dump of third party source code and binaries used for the build. This possibly contains material not for distribution! You should archive this for reference and/or in the event that original sources become unavailable.	

When distributing, you yourself are responsible for fulfilling all license requirements both of this repository and of all third party libraries being used.
There is no warranty that the helper script automatically fulfills all requirements.

# Directories
MissionEditor\data\shared - Data copied to both FS/FA2 distribution
MissionEditor\data\FinalAlert2 - Additional data copied to FA2 distribution
MissionEditor\data\FinalSun - Additional data copied to FS distribution

MissionEditor\PropertySheets - Some property sheets to ease managing the many project configurations

dist - Will contain the output binaries in subfolders. Required DLLs of third-party libraries and the data directory will be copied there using MissionEditor\PropertySheets\common.props

# Contributions
This is an archive repository and will not be maintained. We suggest you fork this repository to fix any issues or add new features.

# Source
Most of the source code has been written around 1999-2001 and does not take advantage of modern C++ features (e.g. smart pointers or RAII) or hardware rendering. However, we've enabled C++20 support and refactored some critical parts to be up to date.
